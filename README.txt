Kit Syntax:
    variable assignment statement is like this
        x : 3
        y : "String"
        z : True

    Expressions
        a + b == a plus b
        a - b == a minus b
        a * b == a times b
        a / b == a divided by b
        a ** b == a to the power of b
        a // b == bth root of a
        a % b == a modulos b
     

    Comparisons
        x :: 3 == x is 3?
        x !: 3 == x is not 3?
        x > 3 == x greater then 3?
        x < 3 == x less then 3?
        x >: 3 == x greater then or equal to 3
        x <: 3 == x less then or equal to 3

    print
        say(x)
